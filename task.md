Test Assignment: Tracking Mentions of the Game and Follower Dynamics on Steam
Objective:
To assess skills in working with APIs, data parsing, data processing, and basic analytics.
Task:
Obtain data on the game’s follower dynamics on Steam:
Collect the history of follower count changes for a game from the SteamDB website (https://steamdb.info/).
Obtain data on mentions of the game in a social network (of your choice):
Choose one social network:
Reddit (recommended) — the easiest API to work with.
Or: Twitter (X), YouTube, Twitch, Itch.io (more complex).
Collect the number of game mentions over the past 30 days (or for the entire available period), using keywords.
For Reddit: for example, the number of posts with the game title in the headline.
Compare the data:
For each day, create a table:

Date | Steam Followers Count | Mentions in Social Media
Group the data by date (daily).
Output the result:
Option A: A table printed to the console or saved as a CSV file.
Option B (bonus): Build a simple graph:
X-axis — Dates
Y-axis — Steam followers
Mentions — plotted as dots on the graph
Execution Format:
Language — Any (Python, JavaScript, Node.js, etc.).
Interface — Not required. Data input can be via variables in the code.
Visualization — Optional, bonus.
Key requirement — The code must be clean, structured, and easy to understand.
Expected Deliverables:
A GitHub repository with the code.
A README file with a brief launch guide:
How to run the project.
How to change parameters (e.g., game name or AppID).
(Optional) Link to a deployed demo.
Evaluation Criteria:
Ability to work with APIs.
Ability to parse web data (if choosing to scrape SteamDB).
Ability to transform and align data.
Code readability and quality.
Estimated Time:
Approximately 2–3 hours for a senior developer.
Important:
This is not a production-level task. A perfect UI or infrastructure is not expected — what matters is your approach to working with data.
